# EK Visual Studio Code extension

Write EK in VSCode using LSP and this extension.

## Install

Install the extension from source using `npm install`.

To run, it needs the EK LSP server installed.

You must then set the VSCode setting `ek.languageServerPath` to `{directory where the EK compiler was cloned}/ek-lsp` (append `.exe` to that on Windows)
